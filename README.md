# Bank-Statement-Transaction-Categorization-System-Using-AI
This project is a Java & Spring Boot–based web application that uses AI techniques to automatically analyze and categorize bank statement transactions. Bank statements often contain unstructured and unclear transaction descriptions, making manual expense tracking difficult.

The system processes uploaded bank statements, extracts transaction details, and intelligently classifies them into categories such as Food, Travel, Shopping, Utilities, Rent, and Others. By leveraging AI/NLP-based keyword analysis and machine learning, the application helps users clearly understand their spending patterns.
